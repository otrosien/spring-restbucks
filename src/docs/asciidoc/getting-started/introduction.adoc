== Introduction

This project is a sample implementation of the Restbucks application described in 
the book REST in Practice by Jim Webber, Savas Parastatidis and Ian Robinson. It's 
a showcase for bringing different Spring eco-system technologies together to implement 
a REST web service. The application uses HAL as the primary representation format.
