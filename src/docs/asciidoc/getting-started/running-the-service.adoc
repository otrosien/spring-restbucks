== Running the service

This service is written using http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot[Spring Boot] which
makes it easy to get it up and running so that you can start exploring the REST API.

At the moment, binaries are not published anywhere. However, building
and running it from source is straightforward. The first step is to clone the Git
repository:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/olivergierke/spring-restbucks.git
----

Once the clone is complete, you're ready to get the service up and running:

[source,bash]
----
$ cd spring-restbucks
$ ./gradlew bootRun
----

You can check that the service is up and running by executing a simple request using
cURL:

include::{snippets}/index-example/curl-request.adoc[]

This request should yield the following response:

include::{snippets}/index-example/http-response.adoc[]

Note the `_links` in the JSON response. They are key to navigating the API.
